# N-Inverted Pendulum
These MATLAB files allow you to get the nonlinear and linear equations of motion for an n-inverted pendulum. The files also stabilize the pendulum using LQR control.
In addition, a simulation file is also provided for convenience. Please note that our parameter values are random and we did not account for any constraints.
Controllability, observability, and stochasticity details are also included.
